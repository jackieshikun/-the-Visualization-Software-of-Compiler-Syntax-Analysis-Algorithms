# -the-Visualization-Software-of-Compiler-Syntax-Analysis-Algorithms

This is a learning-aid software. User can use it to visualize the obsure algorithms in syntax analysis parse of compiler principle.

The syntax analysis algorithms consists of LL1, LR1, LALR1.

The software has single-step function so that user can see the running process of above alogrithms step by step
